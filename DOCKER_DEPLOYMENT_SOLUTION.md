# Docker Deployment Solution - Railway

## The Problem with nixpacks
Railway's nixpacks has persistent issues with Chrome dependencies. The solution is to use a custom Dockerfile instead.

## Solution: Use Dockerfile Instead

I've created a `Dockerfile` that:
- ✅ Uses Node.js 20 Alpine (lightweight)
- ✅ Installs Chromium via apk (Alpine package manager)
- ✅ Sets up Puppeteer to use system Chrome
- ✅ Includes health check endpoint
- ✅ Builds and starts your application

## Key Benefits:
- **No nix package conflicts** - Uses Alpine Linux packages
- **Smaller image size** - Alpine is much lighter than Ubuntu
- **Reliable Chrome installation** - System-managed Chromium
- **Health monitoring** - Built-in health checks for Railway

## Upload Instructions:

### Download Fixed Version:
1. **Download**: `WalkThrough-Docker-Fixed.zip` from Replit
2. **Go to**: Your GitHub repository
3. **Replace all files** with the new version
4. **Commit**: "Switch to Dockerfile for reliable Railway deployment"

### What's Different:
- ✅ **Removed**: nixpacks.toml (causing all the errors)
- ✅ **Added**: Dockerfile (Railway will automatically detect it)
- ✅ **Chrome setup**: Uses Alpine's chromium package
- ✅ **Environment variables**: Configured for Puppeteer

## Expected Result:
Railway will automatically:
1. Detect the Dockerfile
2. Build the Docker image with Chrome
3. Deploy your WalkThrough platform
4. Provide real video recording capabilities

This approach completely bypasses all nixpacks issues and gives you a production-ready deployment.
