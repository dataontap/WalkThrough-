# Push WalkThrough Project to GitHub

## Step 1: Create New GitHub Repository

1. **Go to GitHub**: Visit https://github.com and sign in
2. **Create Repository**: Click the "+" icon → "New repository"
3. **Repository Name**: `WalkThrough`
4. **Description**: `AI-powered walkthrough recording platform with automated browser interaction and video generation`
5. **Visibility**: Public (required for Railway free tier)
6. **Initialize**: Leave unchecked (we'll push existing code)
7. **Click**: "Create repository"

## Step 2: Prepare Local Files

All files are ready in your Replit project. Key files included:

### Core Application:
- `server/` - Express.js backend with Puppeteer automation
- `client/` - React frontend with TypeScript
- `shared/` - Common schemas and types

### Railway Deployment:
- `nixpacks.toml` - Chrome/display libraries configuration
- `railway.json` - Railway deployment settings
- Health check endpoint at `/api/health`

### Documentation:
- `README.md` - Project overview and setup
- `DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md` - Railway deployment steps
- `replit.md` - Project architecture and history

## Step 3: Push to GitHub

Copy these commands and run them in Replit Shell:

```bash
# Initialize git repository
git init

# Add all files
git add .

# Create initial commit
git commit -m "Initial commit: Shookla.ai walkthrough recording platform

- Real browser automation with Puppeteer
- AI-powered script generation (OpenAI + Gemini)
- Video recording and download functionality
- Login automation for web applications
- Emoji-based mood tracking system
- Railway deployment configuration
- Gmail email notification system"

# Add GitHub remote
git remote add origin https://github.com/dataontap/WalkThrough.git

# Push to GitHub
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

## Step 4: Deploy to Railway

After pushing to GitHub:

1. **Go to Railway**: https://railway.app
2. **Sign up**: Use your GitHub account
3. **New Project**: Click "Deploy from GitHub repo"
4. **Select**: Your new WalkThrough repository
5. **Deploy**: Railway detects nixpacks.toml automatically

## Step 5: Add Environment Variables

In Railway project settings, add:

```
NODE_ENV=production
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key_here
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_key_here
GMAIL_USER=your_gmail_here (optional)
GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD=your_app_password_here (optional)
```

## Result After Deployment:

✅ Real Chrome browser automation
✅ Actual screen recordings (no more demo videos)
✅ Login form detection and automation
✅ MP4 video generation and downloads
✅ AI script generation with fallback system
✅ Email notifications (when configured)

Your Railway app URL will be: `https://walkthrough-[random].railway.app`
